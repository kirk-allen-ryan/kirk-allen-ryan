- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kirk-allen-ryan
- I am a builder, first and foremost. I build solutions. I see angles, approaches, opportunities that others don't.
- The How is an attribute, a property - the child of the union of What and Why. I focus on first principles.
  Data is a base commodity - ones and zeros that you pay good money to gather and keep, that you spend too much time worrying over. It's essentially little more than rocks and sand - sprinkled around, its just a mess to clean up, but in sufficient quantities it becomes the land we live on - some of it fertile, some sterile but sturdy to build on, a lot of it wasteland. A lot of it still unexplored...

  The trick is to have your data tell a compelling story. Ever notice that commercial software carries a copywright instead of a patent? Creating good software is empowering users as a willing cast in a good story. Sure, they are creating and accessing data - its the ground they are standing on - but the structures they build and the stories they live and tell on that ground are the point. Ah, the point! 'What is the point?' you just thought...

  The point is that to write good software, you have to know how to write. And tell a good story. Manage a cast of characters - their motives, their backstory, their actions - and manage the setting, the themes, the plot, the twists, the conflicts, and the Big Finish. Code is just an alphabet and a handful of rules to follow - you know, the things we teach to our little kids. Solutions are stories - if you can write a good book, you can probably write a pretty slick application. If you can't, you can't.

  Curiosity and imagination - two attributes that can't be taught, are where great applications come from...
